# SOiCal

An iCal bridge for the Czech edutech provider Å kola OnLine

## Stability

This project is still being worked on. It works with my account, but I can't guarantee that it will work with yours, as the API was reverse-engineered. Most of the values are also hard-coded, so it will only show events from September 2022.

## Building

First set up a Go environment

```
./build.sh
```

## Running

```sh
./bin/server.sh
```
